The contents of this directory can be used to install Teamscale as a windows 
service. This ensures, Teamscale is automatically restarted on system reboot.

To install Teamscale as a service first configure Teamscale and ensure it can 
be started normally. Then follow the next steps to install:

1.) Edit the file teamscale-service.xml

1.1.) Enter/edit the correct path to the Teamscale root directory, 
      for example 
      
      <env name="TEAMSCALE_HOME" value="c:\opt\teamscale" />
      
1.2.) Enter/edit the correct path to the JDK or JRE installation directory, 
      version 1.8 or better, for example 

      <env name="JAVA_HOME" value="c:\program files\java\jdk1.8.0_21" />

1.3.) Optionally uncomment and fill the section <serviceaccount> to run the 
      services as a different user. Alternatively you can set this information
      after installing using the service console, which avoids storing the
      password in clear text.
	  In both cases the user needs to have the "Logon as a service" right.
      This right can be granted in the Local Security Policy management console
      by navigating to "Local Policies > User Rights Assignment" and adding the
      user to "Logon as a service".

2.) Install the Teamscale service by running from the command line:

    teamscale-service.exe install
    
4.) Check that the service is running. Directly after installation, you
    might have to start the services manually or alternatively reboot the 
    server.
    
If you later have to uninstall the service run the following commands:

    teamscale-service.exe uninstall
