The contents of this directory can be used to install the UploadDaemon as a windows 
service. This ensures, the UploadDaemon is automatically restarted on system reboot.

To install the UploadDaemon as a service first configure the UploadDaemon and ensure it can 
be started normally. Then follow the next steps to install:

1.) Edit the file UploadDaemonService.xml and change all parts marked with TODO

2.) Install the UploadDaemon service by running from the command line:

    UploadDaemonService.exe install
    
3.) Check that the service is running. Directly after installation, you
    might have to start the services manually or alternatively reboot the 
    server.
    
If you later have to uninstall the service run the following commands:

    UploadDaemonService.exe uninstall
